# F# Language Design RFCs 

RFCs (requests for comments) and docs related to the F# language design process. 

All open RFCs that have not been released live under `/RFCs`.

All RFCs that have been implemented in a preview of F# live under `/preview`.

All release language and FSharp.Core RFCs live under a folder with their respective release.

All tooling RFCs (typically for cross-cutting, cross-editor tooling) live under `/tooling`.

### The Process:

1. Use [F# Language Suggestions](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions) to submit ideas, vote on them and discuss them.

2. Ideas which get "approved in principle" get an [RFC entry](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/tree/master/RFCs) based on the [template](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/blob/master/RFC_template.md), and a corresponding [RFC discussion thread](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/issues)

   There is currently a backlog of approved ideas. If an idea has been approved and you'd
   like to accelerate the creation of an RFC, send a PR creating the RFC document for any approved-in-principle issue.   
   First in first served.  To "grab the token" send a PR doing nothing but creating or naming the RFC file, and
   then fill in the further details with additional commits to the PR.

   * to pick the RFC numbered identifier, you can run `dotnet fsi find.next.id.fsx`
   * to name the file, tooling RFCs are prefixed with `FST-`, language RFC are prefixed with `FS-`, use `-` and lower casing (relaxed for code identifiers), giving descriptive name
   * the file location is always under RFCs and get moved by owners of the repository when it ships in a preview or a release.



3. Implementations and testing are submitted to the [dotnet/fsharp repository](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp).

When RFCs are implemented and a version of F# is revved, the RFCs which correspond to the F# version they were implemented in are archived under the appropriate folder.

### Language Update Release Trains

1. Delivery of language features is via RFCs plus implementations submitted to https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp.

2. New features that meet our quality bar are then merged and placed beyond a preview flag in the F# compiler and FSharp.Core.

3. When we have a handful of 100% “ready, tested and completed” FSharp.Core and F# Language features in preview that aren't "too minor", then we will bump the language version and begin tactical work to release them in a few  months.

4. New releases of F# typically align with a .NET and/or Visual Studio version.

### Roadmap and Areas of Priority Work

Any or all of the [approved-in-principle](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/labels/approved-in-principle) items are eligible to catch a release train. That is as good as it gets for a "roadmap" for the language design.

The BDFL (@dsyme) has put together a list of "proposed priority" approved language design items which he plans to focus on or which other people have taken past RFC stage.  This is _not_ a roadmap, because other people will choose to prioritize other approved items (e.g. match! - which is not a priority item for me), and is also subject to change and edit.. It is an informal list.  You can find that list here: https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/labels/proposed-priority
